## ✨ About Me

A curious tech soul blending Salesforce development with a growing love for data.  
From resolving 1,000+ support issues to designing flows, LWCs, and integrating third-party apps — the focus has always been to create clean, effective solutions.

With a Master’s degree in Data Science & Applications, I’m also diving deep into data interpretation, visualization, and process automation.

💡 Let’s just say: If it’s logical, structured, and a bit of a challenge — I’m in.
